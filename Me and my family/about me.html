  <p class="text-center">This website will showcase about me   &nbsp;</p>
 <p class="FitImage"><img src="images/1.jpg" alt=""/>
  <p>This is my school. You can see a hollow metal ball in the photo, which is the iconic building of our school. The name of our school is written on the ball: Ningbo Foreign Affairs College. I studied art design at this school, and my teachers are very strict. They taught me a lot about design and software application knowledge. My classmates are also very friendly, and my career plan is to become an advertising designer because in daily life, I enjoy watching various interesting advertisements, including color matching and special effects production, which are very interesting, I hope one day I can also use my skills to create perfect advertising works!&nbsp;</p>
  <p class="FitImage"><img src="images/6.jpg" alt=""/>
    <p>My hobbies are painting, photography, dancing and so on. I can draw sketches, gouache and oil paintings. What I like most is to paint landscapes with colorful paints. It is very meaningful to paint landscapes on paper with brush strokes and gives me a sense of accomplishment. I am also very interested in photography, I will use the camera to record all kinds of things in my life, after shooting, I will edit the photo, adjust its saturation, contrast and so on, to make it look more perfect, and then I will share the photo on my social platform for my friends to see together. I learned Latin dance since kindergarten and got the certificate of Level 10. But now I like Kpop music, so I will learn to dance some Kpop dance. Dancing enriches my spare time and exercises my body at the same time. These hobbies are an essential part of my life and I hope I can always love them!&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="FitImage"><img src="images/7.jpg" alt=""> &nbsp;</p>
    <p class="FitImage">This is a photo taken during our school's spring outing to Ningbo Fangte Amusement Park. My classmate helped me take this photo. The weather was very good that day, and I played many projects, such as roller coasters, carousels, pirate ships, and so on. We had a great time!
In daily life, I also like to go out and play with friends. I like to go shopping with friends to buy delicious food, taste it, or play in the secret room to escape and relax. I cherish the time with my friends very much, and I am also looking forward to the graduation trip with my friends after graduation this year!</p>
